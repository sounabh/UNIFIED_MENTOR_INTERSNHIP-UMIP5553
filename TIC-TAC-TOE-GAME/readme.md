LETS START

PROJECT APPROACH - 

* FIRST I WRITE ALL ABOUT HTML THE BOARD AND THE CELLS .BASICALLY I MADE THE STRUCTURE LAYOUT WITH HTML WITH CONTAINER, CELLS, DIVS,BUTTONS,BASIC HEADINGS
* THEN I MOVED TO STYLING WITH CSS. I APPROACH THE CELLS THROUGH GRIDB SYSTEM AND BASIC STYLING

 PROJECT APPROACH IN JAVASCRIPT -

 * SELECT ALL REQUIREMENTS WITH QUERYSELECTORS 
 * MAKE FUNCTION TO START THE GAME WITH CLICK EVENTS AND CHANGE PLAYERS TURN WITH CONDITIONS
 * ON CLICK WE USE TEXTCONTENT TO ADD THE VALUE IN UI
 * BY USE CONDITIONS I CHECK THE EMPTY CELLS AND ADD MY X-O OTHERWISE IT OVVERIDES THE CURRENT PLAYER
 * THEN I MAKE THE ARRAY OF WINNING CONDITONS ITS A 2D ARRAY AND LATER DESTRUCTURED IT
 * AFTER THAT I CHECK THAT ALL THE WINING CONDITONS TEXTCONTENT IS SAME THEN WE RETURN TRUE
 * THEN I MAKE A FUNCTION FOR CHECK TIE IF THERE NO EMPTY CELLS LEFT AND OUR PLAYERS DIDNT WIN 
 * AFTER I ADD A DISABLED STYLED CLASS ON COMPLETIONS
* THEN I MAKE THE RESTART BUTTON THAT ON RESTART CLICK W MAKE OUR TEXT CONTENT EMPTY
* THEN MAKE I  ALERT DIV AND DISPLAY BLOCK WITH JS AND SETINTERVAL
